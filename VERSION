Render Deployment Fix

Fixed critical deployment timeout issue on Render platform.

Root Cause:
- Server was not binding to '0.0.0.0' (required for Render's external health checks)
- Missing health check endpoint for Render to probe

Changes:
- Added health check routes: GET / and GET /health
- Server now binds to '0.0.0.0' explicitly
- Added detailed startup logging showing PORT and host
- Ensures Render can successfully probe the service during deployment

Previous Version (V410):
- Server-Authoritative Architecture Implementation
- 60Hz server game loop with 20Hz network updates
- Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
