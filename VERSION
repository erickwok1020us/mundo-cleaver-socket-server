Backend Fix: Real Delta Time for Movement Synchronization

Fixed critical server-side movement timing issue causing desynchronization.

Root Cause:
- Server was using fixed TICK_INTERVAL (16.67ms) for movement calculations
- Assumed game loop always runs at exactly 60Hz
- When server loop slips even slightly (common on cloud platforms), effective movement speed becomes slower
- This caused opponent to appear moving slowly on client screens

Changes:
- Added real delta time calculation in tick() function
- Changed updatePlayerMovement(dt) to use actual elapsed time instead of fixed interval
- Changed updateKnives(dt) to use actual elapsed time
- Added dt clamping (max 0.1s) to prevent huge jumps after pauses
- Added time-based network update accumulator (replaces tick counter)
- Added per-second logging: ticks/sec and broadcasts/sec for monitoring
- Movement now uses: moveDistance = PLAYER_SPEED * dt (where dt is in seconds)

Technical Details:
- PLAYER_SPEED remains 2.5 units/second
- dt is calculated as: (now - lastUpdateTime) / 1000 and clamped to max 0.1s
- Network updates accumulate time and broadcast when >= 1/20 seconds (50ms)
- Server logs actual tick rate and broadcast rate every second for monitoring

Previous Fixes (V416):

Issue 1: Render Deployment Timeout
Root Cause:
- Server was not binding to '0.0.0.0' (required for Render's external health checks)
- Missing health check endpoint for Render to probe

Changes:
- Added health check routes: GET / and GET /health
- Server now binds to '0.0.0.0' explicitly
- Added detailed startup logging showing PORT and host

Issue 2: Team Selection Blocked in 1v1 Mode
Root Cause:
- teamSelect handler blocked ALL team selection in 1v1 mode
- Should only block team SWITCHING, not initial selection

Changes:
- Fixed teamSelect handler to check if player is already in a team
- Only blocks switching after player is assigned (allows first-time selection)
- Added comprehensive debugging logs with [TEAM-SELECT-SERVER] prefix
- Added team capacity validation (1v1: 1 per team, 3v3: 3 per team)

Issue 3: Host Disconnect Not Handled
Root Cause:
- When host disconnected, room remained open with guests stuck inside
- No cleanup or notification to remaining players

Changes:
- Added host disconnect detection in disconnect handler
- When host disconnects, emit hostDisconnected event to all players
- Immediately close room and clean up game engine
- Added [DISCONNECT] logging for debugging

Previous Version (V410):
- Server-Authoritative Architecture Implementation
- 60Hz server game loop with 20Hz network updates
- Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
