V416

Release Date: 2025-01-30

Backend Fixes: Deployment + Team Selection + Host Disconnect

Fixed three critical backend issues.

Issue 1: Render Deployment Timeout
Root Cause:
- Server was not binding to '0.0.0.0' (required for Render's external health checks)
- Missing health check endpoint for Render to probe

Changes:
- Added health check routes: GET / and GET /health
- Server now binds to '0.0.0.0' explicitly
- Added detailed startup logging showing PORT and host

Issue 2: Team Selection Blocked in 1v1 Mode
Root Cause:
- teamSelect handler blocked ALL team selection in 1v1 mode
- Should only block team SWITCHING, not initial selection

Changes:
- Fixed teamSelect handler to check if player is already in a team
- Only blocks switching after player is assigned (allows first-time selection)
- Added comprehensive debugging logs with [TEAM-SELECT-SERVER] prefix
- Added team capacity validation (1v1: 1 per team, 3v3: 3 per team)

Issue 3: Host Disconnect Not Handled
Root Cause:
- When host disconnected, room remained open with guests stuck inside
- No cleanup or notification to remaining players

Changes:
- Added host disconnect detection in disconnect handler
- When host disconnects, emit hostDisconnected event to all players
- Immediately close room and clean up game engine
- Added [DISCONNECT] logging for debugging
